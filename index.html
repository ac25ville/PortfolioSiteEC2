        To Whom It May Concern, 
        <br /><br />
        I am seeking Internships and/or Cooperative experiences in Software Engineering/Development, and related fields. I believe I am qualified for a position such as this for many reasons, with the top three being my motivation—in and outside the classroom—my meticulous work ethic, and my leadership skills. 
        <br /><br />
        My motivation is primarily driven by a want to succeed. Success can be defined and found in many ways. The simplest way to look at success is quantitatively, but the way I value my success is qualitative with the quantitative measurement as a reward. This outlook comes from personally being satisfied by learning something new or the pride I have in my work. 
        <br /><br />
        Since coming to the University of Missouri, my previous professions and extracurricular activities have helped develop my strong work ethic. The methodical style in which I work, I believe to be very beneficial to the field of computer science and the processes required for it. 
        <br /><br />
        My leadership skills and experiences come from many avenues. Through my fraternity, Sigma Phi Delta, I served as the Accreditation Chairman. In the time I served as the first chairman, the most profound contribution I made was the expectations I set for those after me. I recently was elected to handle the responsibilities of the External Vice Chief Engineer. This position holds a lot of international responsibility and involves relations with other organizations on campus. I hope that it is just the start of my continuing leadership in my communities. 
        <br /><br />
        Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. 
        <br /><br />
        Best regards, 
        <br /><br />
        Austin Corteville
